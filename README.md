Automating Tasks using Linux scripting
1. Write a shell script to find and delete all files in a directory that are older than 30 days.

2. Create a script to monitor the disk usage of a server. If usage exceeds 80%, log the details to a file and send an alert email.

3. Write a script that renames all .txt files in a directory by appending the current date to the filename.

4. Create a script that checks if a particular service (e.g., httpd or nginx) is running. If not, it should restart the service and log the action.

5. Write a script to monitor CPU and memory usage every minute and log the details if CPU usage is above 90% or memory usage exceeds 75%.

6. Write a script that performs a backup of a specified directory and compresses it with the current date in the filename. Schedule it to run daily using cron.

7. Create a script to check the availability of a list of websites. For each site, if it's unreachable, log the URL and send an alert.

8. Write a Python script using boto3 to list all S3 buckets in an AWS account and their respective sizes.

9. Develop a script that starts and stops EC2 instances based on a schedule (e.g., start at 8 AM and stop at 8 PM).
